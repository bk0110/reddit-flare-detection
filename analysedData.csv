chair years inr lakhs pepperfry sales executives take purchase order tata motor put order system input purcahse order trigger three function delivery products service b invoice payment order c postsale service maintenance pregst invoice gst come picture bill would generate pepperfry single bill centrally ie would generate bill lakhs extra relevant vat tax detail two organizations would one single bill entire deal irrespective state city etc would give tata motor one single piece paper say owe lakhs due date payment manoj pepperfrys collection manager tata motor submit single invoice tata motor office check tata motor procurement finance team nothing wrong invoice payment clear due date point focus one invoice need delivery chair service entire country manoj submit one invoice follow invoice collect payment one invoice tata motor team verify one invoice process payment one invoice one tax number bill address need invoice do centrally something wrong invoice manoj correct one invoice resubmit tata motor postgst invoice like mention gst dictate invoice do state service deliver ie separate gst file state explain mean separate invoice generate state involve transaction one state involve one invoice two state involve two invoice five state involve five invoice case since twenty state involve twenty invoice value invoice split direct proportion usage rs total bill value three state maharashtra kerala usage bill maharashtra kerala sense separate company state term gst move implication tata motor pepperfry transaction since chair deliver state tata motor pepperfry register office twenty state along gst number state tata motor issue purchase order proportionate value pepperfry ie lakhs split proportionally state sales executive enter twenty purchase

process repeat find fault b incorrect gst po invoice suppose particular invoice wrong gst mean ca nt process incorrect tax information mean money ca nt collect invoice gst would one wrong tax number could one two twenty mistake happen real life one common things face mistake happen gst well happen multiples really ca nt expect people make mistake always efficiency go multiple time effort require fix mistake c miss gst nt necessary company gst registration every state tata motor might register office state example ie wo nt gst number provide declaration pepperfry say nt gst number two state pepperfry able give invoice payment money delay till get declaration experience take long time tata motor say nt able claim input tax credit state like leave money table get declaration basically say will lose money transaction require approvals upto highest level loss company manoj follow two time consume things get amount money thus efficiency go cash flow cash lifeline company company without

pay things nt cash thus healthy cash flow one important aspects business survival company company people cash flow would oxygen invoice cash bring company decrease efficiency collection managers delay introduce collection cash pregst cash collect days would take say days collection managers efficiency go tiny delay add incorrect gst add another days cash collect miss gst add days etc two outcomes firstly pepperfry earlier predict get money days receive days mean lakhs need 30th day daily expense need find somewhere else since days come another weeks dip reserve days secondly money lose value lakhs end days since time pass lose value due time value money could generate interest could invest delay hence value lose loss pepperfry summarize gst delay payment cycle company take longer collect

deal actually go b invoice process always go many get stick payment delay may never come due process issue money linger never come pepperfry become bad debt invoice get stick reason like incorrect gst miss gst incorrect value cash wo nt collect invoice amount get reduce profit invoice nt get process lakhs profit less say lakhs lakhs collect deal pepperfry actually make loss deal biggest culprits psu like hpcl bpcl ubi etc requirements stringent single mistake hold invoice payment could get delay years thus profit deal impact wo nt pay till everything invoice correct could delay multiple reason many businesses nt sell psu reason profit cash get stick business different pregst earlier say mistake one invoice fix could many amount revenue chance wo nt make amount profit thus due lower

maintenance total bill lakh rupees chair inr lakhs installation chair offices across state inr lakhs maintenance chair years inr lakhs pepperfry sales executives take purchase order tata motor put order system input purcahse order trigger three function delivery products service b invoice payment order c postsale service maintenance pregst invoice gst come picture bill would generate pepperfry single bill centrally ie would generate bill lakhs extra relevant vat tax detail two organizations would one single bill entire deal irrespective state city etc would give tata motor one single piece paper say owe lakhs due date payment manoj pepperfrys collection manager tata motor submit single invoice tata motor office check tata motor procurement finance team nothing wrong invoice payment clear due date point focus one invoice need delivery chair service entire country manoj submit one invoice follow invoice collect payment one invoice tata motor team verify one invoice process payment one invoice one tax number bill address need invoice do centrally something wrong invoice manoj correct one invoice resubmit tata motor postgst invoice like mention gst dictate invoice do state service deliver ie separate gst file state explain mean separate invoice generate state involve transaction one state involve one invoice two state involve two invoice five state involve five invoice case since twenty state involve twenty invoice value invoice split direct proportion usage rs total bill value three state maharashtra kerala usage bill maharashtra kerala sense separate company state term gst move implication tata motor pepperfry transaction since chair deliver state tata motor pepperfry register office twenty state along gst number state tata motor issue purchase order proportionate value pepperfry ie lakhs split proportionally state sales executive enter twenty purchase order system deliveries trigger state different invoice hand manoj generation manoj submit invoice pepperfry whose procurement department verify invoice give finance verify initiate payments payments receive tata motor bank transaction id manoj verify payments close transaction ideal scenario might able tell effort require everyone involve deal go time effort require one state involve buy side ie maharastra sell maharashtra twice effort two state involve buy side ie maharashtra sell kerala possibility go upto time effort require previously amount money since state union territories yes union territories treat separately well impact efficiencyeffort pepperfry still go make lakhs deal effort require twenty time tata motor give purchase order invoice generate time take process invoice value impact time take collect money invoice template value different example maharashtra chair inr lakhs installation inr 50k support inr lakhs kerala chair inr lakhs installation inr 30k support inr 90k chair inr lakhs installation inr lakh support inr lakhs total money collect sales executive manoj procurement guy finance guy time work add value efficiency scenario go arguably go state union territories involve although rare case also like say ideal scenario nt always go smoothly challenge encounter incorrect proportion purchase order invoice someone make mistake need allocate allocate process repeat find fault b incorrect gst po invoice suppose particular invoice wrong gst mean ca nt process incorrect tax information mean money ca nt collect invoice gst would one wrong tax number could one two twenty mistake happen real life one common things face mistake happen gst well happen multiples really ca nt expect people make mistake always efficiency go multiple time effort require fix mistake c miss gst nt necessary company gst registration every state tata motor might register office state example ie wo nt gst number provide declaration pepperfry say nt gst number two state pepperfry able give invoice payment money delay till get declaration experience take long time tata motor say nt able claim input tax credit state like leave money table get declaration basically say will lose money transaction require approvals upto highest level loss company manoj follow two time consume things get amount money thus efficiency go cash flow cash lifeline company company without cash survive could value billion dollars nt cash pay employees shut kingfisher could nt pay employees interest vendors nt cash leave jet nt cash payment salaries fuel loan payments etc bsnl struggle pay things nt cash thus healthy cash flow one important aspects business survival company company people cash flow would oxygen invoice cash bring company decrease efficiency collection managers delay introduce collection cash pregst cash collect days would take say days collection managers efficiency go tiny delay add incorrect gst add another days cash collect miss gst add days etc two outcomes firstly pepperfry earlier predict get money days receive days mean lakhs need 30th day daily expense need find somewhere else since days come another weeks dip reserve days secondly money lose value lakhs end days since time pass lose value due time value money could generate interest could invest delay hence value lose loss pepperfry summarize gst delay payment cycle company take longer collect amount money use gst introduce money take longer come take longer go salaries interest payments vendor payments outflows impact profit profit make deal vary company company deal deal let us assume pepperfry make profit deal ie lakhs due follow factor profit get impact payment cycle delay collect profit longer duration collect lakhs start make profit could say collect invoice remain give profit basically profit generation delay cash flow delay mean profit make deal lose value pregst lakhs less lakhs value due time value money efficiency go effort require generate amount profit go thus profit deal actually go b invoice process always go many get stick payment delay may never come due process issue money linger never come pepperfry become bad debt invoice get stick reason like incorrect gst miss gst incorrect value cash wo nt collect invoice amount get reduce profit invoice nt get process lakhs profit less say lakhs lakhs collect deal pepperfry actually make loss deal biggest culprits psu like hpcl bpcl ubi etc requirements stringent single mistake hold invoice payment could get delay years thus profit deal impact wo nt pay till everything invoice correct could delay multiple reason many businesses nt sell psu reason profit cash get stick business different pregst earlier say mistake one invoice fix could many amount revenue chance wo nt make amount profit thus due lower efficiency longer payment cycle stick payments profit make get impact conclusion ramble due statespecific nature gst effort require make amount money pregst era go impact revenue thus profit make company problems everyone face gst want business multiple state ready face challenge feel free discuss impact economy opinion big impact really need someone much knowledgeable analyze publish feel deserve conversation least one change impact revenue profit extensively make make money harder thus go last impact economy worst part nt look like system go change near future probably put tl dr later
